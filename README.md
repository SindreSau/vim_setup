# Vim Setup Script

## Prerequisites:

* **Vim:** Instructions in the script indicate how to install Vim if it's missing.
* **`curl`:** Used for downloading files (colorscheme, vim-plug). Most systems should have this by default.
* **Optional (`tree`)**: For nicely displaying the folder structure. 

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   * Open a terminal
   * Move into the desired directory to download the repo into
     * Home-directory is recommended: `cd ~`
   * Run: `git clone https://github.com/SindreSau/vim_setup`
   * Move into the new directory: `cd vim_setup`

2. **Make it Executable:**
   *  Open a terminal.
   *  Navigate to the directory where you saved `vim_setup.sh`.
   *  Run: `chmod +x vim_setup.sh`

3. **Run the Script:**
    *  In your terminal, execute the script: `./vim_setup.sh`
